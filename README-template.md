## Overview
This challenge was meant to help improve my coding skills by pushing me to create a responsive rating landing page. This was relatively new to me as I am new to coding and frontend development.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I started out structuring my Html content to fit the challenge description and then progressed to styling all the different aspect using CSS. the styles and color schemes used were provided by the frontend mentor style guide. Functionality was added using Javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript



### What I learned

I am proud of every line of code I wrote.



### Continued development

I would love to continue working on my use of Javascript as i still have issues understanding the concept.
